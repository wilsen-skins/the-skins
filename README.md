# the-skins
These are all skins that i've made. These are all mixes of other skins. I personally only use the azer -ite edit for everything. lmao series was my first try at creating skin mixes, my goal was to make skins for tourneys. lmk if you like any of these :)

i play every mode with this cause i wanna get used to using 1 skin. i picked azer -ite as a base for this using random number generator :p all the elements are from skins of players from isnpiration list on my profile

designed for hr. honestly not a biggest fan of this, basically a very slight whitecat skin edit, but i think it might be good as a nm skin as well
